	<h1>Ghazal</h1>
	<p>jāntī huuñ ki vo ḳhafā bhī nahīñ 

dil kisī taur māntā bhī nahīñ </p>

<p>kyā vafā o jafā kī baat kareñ 

darmiyāñ ab to kuchh rahā bhī nahīñ</p>

<p>dard vo bhī sahā hai tere liye 

merī qismat meñ jo likhā bhī nahīñ</p> 

<p>har tamannā sarāb bantī rahī 

in sarāboñ kī intihā bhī nahīñ</p> 

<p>haañ charāġhāñ kī kaifiyat thī kabhī 

ab to palkoñ pe ik diyā bhī nahīñ</p>

<p>dil ko ab tak yaqīn aa na sakā 

yuuñ nahīñ hai ki vo milā bhī nahīñ</p>

<p>vaqt itnā guzar chukā hai 'hinā' 

jaane vaale se ab gila bhī nahīñ</p>
