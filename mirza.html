	<h1>About Him</h1>
	<img src="mirza.jpg" width="200" height="200">
	<p><i><strong><ghalib>Ghalib</ghalib> is the poetical surname of Asadullah Khan, the greatest poet of Urdu. He is the last of the great Delhi poets, and is the first of the great modern poets. He stands between two worlds. Trained in classical Persian and mystic philosophy, he also profited from the western influences and the spirit of Indian Renaissance. “He employed ‘heterogeneous ideas’ and ‘yoked them together with voilence’ like the English Metaphysical poets. He towers above the hundreds and hundreds of Urdu poets like a ‘victor’ (Ghalib), as his pseudonym means.
